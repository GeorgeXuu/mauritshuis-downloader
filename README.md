# mauritshuis-downloader
Bash script for downloading pictures from https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/our-collection/

The script downloads almost all pictures from the Mauritshuis Museum except for pictures with weird URL. Pictures are downloaded with maximum resolution.

Make sure that in your directory, filename `123` is available. It is used as a tmp file.
